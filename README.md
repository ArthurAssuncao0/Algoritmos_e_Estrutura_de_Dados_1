## Informations

- In this repository you will find some TADs that were made to do exercises for the subject "Algorithms and Data Structures 1", which I took in my second term at university (2022-2). All the exercises were done by Arthur Alves Assunção using the C development language.

- The Static List TAD was not performed.
